## Using Weather API For Polybar

You must fill out scripts/.local/bin/.env.example accordingly in order for scripts/.local/bin/weather to work properly.

## Extras

Dual monitor wallpapers included in the wallpapers directory!
My OBS recording settings and xdg-mime apps (soon to be actually filled out) are also included.

## PS

Most of the ricing is stolen from [Eric Murphy's Dotfiles](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/archrice), as I followed his youtube series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnur5_dvCveFGV8tKbH9sdqOSBUlFNQrR).
