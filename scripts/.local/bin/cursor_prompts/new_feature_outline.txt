# New Feature Outline

Use this outline as you build out a new feature.

## 1. Requirements Gathering

- [ ] Define feature scope
- [ ] List acceptance criteria
- [ ] If any user requirements are unclear, ask for clarification repeatedly until they become clear.
- [ ] Ensure all requirements are fully understood before proceeding with the implementation.

## 2. Design

- [ ] Create high-level architecture
- [ ] Design UI/UX (if applicable)
- [ ] Identify potential technical challenges

## 3. Implementation

- [ ] Break down tasks
- [ ] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Refactor and optimize; thing about potential bottlenecks and how to address them.

## 4. Documentation

- [ ] Document code

## Notes

- Prioritize code readability and maintainability. You don't have to write comments for every little thing; only use comments for dense code or concepts that are not self-explanatory.
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments to explain "why" behind the code in more complex functions
- Use functions with a single, focused (single responsibility)
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully
